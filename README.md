# Styling-a-navigation-bar-using-CSS

I am learning as I code. This is not entirely my own code.
I noted in comment outs where I personally edit the code from my current skill set.

15 Oct 2021 I added hsla opacity to the nav bar. I added display: inline-block;, transform and transition to the buttons.
